# bit-wise-mask-encryption
Encrypting text files reversibly using the bitwise XOR operator


This is my first C++ program, so its very basic.

All it does is take in user input, either from the commandline or from a given textfile, and encrypts it according to a bitwise mask "key".

It then outputs the result to a file called "output.txt"
I have included a sample encrypted file, which can be decoded with the key "163".

Note that becaues the encryption is reversible, encryption and decryption are exactly the same process.
